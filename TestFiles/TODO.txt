Finish the IDF processing to Radaince via Honeybee method 
    - Remap triangulated surfaces to 3d coordinates
    - Create HBsurfaces with corresponding properties for Radiance plot
    - Generate test grid within zone (perhaps via honeybee method after defining the floor (grid from surface maybe?))
    - Generate recipe and send to Radiance (for annual and DF)
    - Define psot processing

Create basic docker instance/container for ubuntu Linux to run Radiance and Energyplus (on Mac!)

Send job to the container on buuil - or map ddirectory to sthat files can be passded and tested

Docker file and commands for instaling Radiance and Energyplsu and Python/Honeybee very important

Or maybe how to run Radiance code from input files geenrated using Honeybee??
