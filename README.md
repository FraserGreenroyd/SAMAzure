# Run process

1.  Create Rhino model as surfaces. Generate individual zones from surfaces (including air-walls and glazing objects) using Honeybee and save to IDF somewhere.
2.  Using ReconfigureIDF, a weatherfile and config JSON, generate a ready-to-simulate IDF file. The command to run this is:
    -  ```python ReconfigureIDF.py -i <input IDF file> -w <weather file> -t <internal gains template> -c <config file> -o <output IDF file>``` The usage of this command can be found by running ```python ReconfigureIDF.py -h```
3.  Generate a set of files ready for simulation in Radiance from the IDF using IDFToHoneybeeRadiance. The command to run this is:
    -  ```python IDFToHoneybeeRadiance.py -i <input IDF file> -w <weather file> -c <config file> -o <output directory> -gs <analysis grid size>``` The usage of this command can be found by running ```python IDFToHoneybeeRadiance.py -h```
4. Run the Radiance case from the source files generated by the previous step (IDFToHoneybeeRadiance) using RunHoneybeeRadiance. The command to run this is:
    -  ```python run_HBradiance.py -p <analysis points file> -sm <sky matrix file> -s <surfaces file> -o <results output directory> -q <quality of simulation>``` The usage of this command can be found by running ```python run_HBradiance.py -h```
